At that time, I felt like a child who had just learned to ride a bicycle, filled with excitement about this “new toy.” However, I soon realized that this was just the tip of the iceberg. While code generation is thrilling, the challenges we face in actual development are far more complex.<br>This realization propelled me into a deeper exploration, particularly in the area of code refactoring. I discovered that Cursor exhibited surprising potential. When I provided it with some refactoring instructions, it not only understood my intentions but also restructured the code as expected, and at an astonishing speed. This made me dream: if I could apply this skill in daily development, I could be leisurely “fishing” while others were still buried in refactoring!</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Reality-Check-The-Dilemma-of-Refactoring-Complex-Projects\"><a href=\"#The-Reality-Check-The-Dilemma-of-Refactoring-Complex-Projects\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Reality Check: The Dilemma of Refactoring Complex Projects\"></a>The Reality Check: The Dilemma of Refactoring Complex Projects</h2><p>However, reality often delivers a harsh blow. When I confidently applied this straightforward refactoring approach to real projects, I quickly hit a wall. The complexity of real projects far exceeded that of simple AI tool code projects, and simple prompts felt like trying to use a toothpick to move an elephant.</p>\n<p><strong>Main Issues Encountered:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Uncontrolled Scope of Changes</strong>: Each refactor felt like a random walk without a map.</li>\n<li><strong>Chaotic Refactoring Strategies</strong>: Relying entirely on large models to select refactoring strategies was akin to handing the steering wheel to a blindfolded driver.</li>\n<li><strong>Contextual Understanding Barriers</strong>: Even with @Codebase, Cursor seemed oblivious to the overall project context, leading to aimless refactoring.</li>\n<li><strong>Code Review Burden</strong>: Each change required meticulous review; otherwise, it felt like dancing on the edge of a knife.</li>\n<li><strong>Vicious Cycle</strong>: The more I refactored, the messier it became, ultimately forcing me to start over and fall into a “start over - fail again” loop.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Root Cause Analysis:</strong><br>After deep reflection, several core reasons emerged:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Excessive Logical Complexity:</strong> Real projects often contain intricate business logic and conditional judgments.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Framework Knowledge:</strong> There was insufficient onboarding for AI regarding frameworks.</li>\n<li><strong>Diversity in Coding Styles:</strong> Variations in coding styles among different developers posed challenges.</li>\n<li><strong>Overwhelming Contextual Burden:</strong> Too many interrelated codes formed a complex web of dependencies.</li>\n<li><strong>Unpredictable Behavior:</strong> It was impossible to accurately anticipate the AI’s next actions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Human-vs-Machine-Differences-in-Refactoring-Mindsets\"><a href=\"#Human-vs-Machine-Differences-in-Refactoring-Mindsets\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Human vs. Machine: Differences in Refactoring Mindsets\"></a>Human vs. Machine: Differences in Refactoring Mindsets</h2><p>To find a breakthrough, I pondered why human developers could navigate refactoring relatively smoothly while AI frequently stumbled.</p>\n<p><strong>Human Developer’s Refactoring Approach:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Systematic Analysis:</strong> Identifying and eliminating code smells first to enhance readability and scalability.</li>\n<li><strong>Object-Oriented Optimization:</strong> Refactoring based on best practices in object-oriented design.</li>\n<li><strong>Architectural Adjustments:</strong> Reorganizing code into appropriate hierarchical structures.</li>\n<li><strong>Testing Validation:</strong> Ensuring that the refactored code still meets expected behaviors.<br><strong>AI’s Refactoring Approach:</strong> It resembles a mechanical worker simply repeating the action of “modifying code,” lacking the systematic thinking and strategic planning we expect.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Inspiration-Strikes-Insights-from-the-ReAct-Framework\"><a href=\"#Inspiration-Strikes-Insights-from-the-ReAct-Framework\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Inspiration Strikes: Insights from the ReAct Framework\"></a>Inspiration Strikes: Insights from the ReAct Framework</h2><p>In my quest for solutions, I encountered Agent and ReAct along with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which sparked an idea. If we could enable AI to think like humans and reason in ways we expect, could we overcome the current challenges?</p>\n<h3 id=\"Overview-of-the-ReAct-Framework\"><a href=\"#Overview-of-the-ReAct-Framework\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Overview of the ReAct Framework\"></a>Overview of the ReAct Framework</h3><p>The ReAct framework was proposed by Shunyu Yao et al. in 2022 as a method that combines reasoning and action to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). This framework allows LLMs to alternately generate <strong>reasoning traces</strong> and <strong>task-specific operations</strong>, enabling models to induce, track, and update operational plans effectively while handling exceptions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interaction with External Tools:</strong> The ReAct framework enables LLMs to interact with external knowledge bases or environments for additional information, providing more reliable responses.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance Improvement:</strong> Research shows that ReAct outperforms several advanced baseline models in language and decision-making tasks while enhancing LLMs’ interpretability and trustworthiness.</li>\n<li><strong>Integration with Chain-of-Thought (CoT):</strong> Combining ReAct with CoT allows for leveraging both internal knowledge and external information during reasoning for optimal results.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Practice-Constructing-Refactoring-Specific-Prompts\"><a href=\"#Practice-Constructing-Refactoring-Specific-Prompts\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Practice: Constructing Refactoring-Specific Prompts\"></a>Practice: Constructing Refactoring-Specific Prompts</h2><p><strong>Designing Refactoring Steps:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Basic Cleanup:</strong> Identify and address fundamental code smells.</li>\n<li><strong>Object-Oriented Optimization:</strong> Apply best practices in object-oriented design.</li>\n<li><strong>Architectural Adjustments:</strong> Restructure code according to hexagonal architecture standards.</li>\n<li><strong>Error Fixing:</strong> Address obvious compilation errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Review:</strong> Supplement detail optimization.</li>\n<li><strong>Test Fixes:</strong> Ensure all test cases pass.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/../images/new_refactoring_processing.jpg\" alt=\"new_refactoring_processing.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Designing Refactoring Prompt Template:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Context Explanation:</strong> Provide architectural standards and best practice guidelines.</li>\n<li><strong>Thinking Steps:</strong> Guide AI through systematic analysis.</li>\n<li><strong>Observation Records:</strong> Document identified issues. </li>\n<li><strong>Action Guidelines:</strong> Clearly outline specific refactoring steps.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/../images/prompt_design.jpg\" alt=\"prompt_design.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Based on insights from ReAct and CoT, I designed a prompt for DDD refactoring on the current project (covering the first three steps):<br><strong>Prompt for Refactoring</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"highlight markdown\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br><span class=\"line\">17</span><br><span class=\"line\">18</span><br><span class=\"line\">19</span><br><span class=\"line\">20</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">Context: In hexagonal architecture DDD implementation patterns, there are best practices and experiences regarding the design and implementation of Application Service, Domain Service, Query, and Port.

The combination of ReAct and CoT allowed models to integrate information effectively during reasoning processes, reducing errors and uncertainties significantly.</li>\n<li><strong>Goal-Oriented Thinking Process:</strong> After adopting the ReAct framework, the model’s reasoning direction aligned more closely with user expectations rather than being influenced by hallucinations (i.e., generating false information). By introducing additional information sources (observational steps provide necessary information), models could verify and update their reasoning paths in real time.</li>\n<li><strong>Visualized Thinking and Modification Process:</strong> In Cursor’s composer mode, users can clearly see intermediate thought processes and modifications. This transparency enables developers to track each modification step better understand how models arrive at conclusions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Key-Factors-for-Improved-Outcomes\"><a href=\"#Key-Factors-for-Improved-Outcomes\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Key Factors for Improved Outcomes:\"></a>Key Factors for Improved Outcomes:</h3><ol>\n<li><strong>Clear Boundaries:</strong> Context limits AI’s behavioral scope.</li>\n<li><strong>Defined Steps:</strong> Guides AI through predetermined thought processes during refactoring.</li>\n<li><strong>Feedback Loop Closure:</strong> Each step has clear observation and action guidelines.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Shift-in-Mindset\"><a href=\"#Shift-in-Mindset\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Shift in Mindset:\"></a>Shift in Mindset:</h3><p>This process made me realize that using AI effectively hinges on shifting our mindset from “problem-oriented” to “guided collaboration.” Our roles should be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Humans handle analysis and planning,</li>\n<li>AI executes specific details,</li>\n<li>Establish bridges through well-designed prompts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion-A-New-Paradigm-for-AI-Coding-Assistants\"><a href=\"#Conclusion-A-New-Paradigm-for-AI-Coding-Assistants\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion: A New Paradigm for AI Coding Assistants\"></a>Conclusion: A New Paradigm for AI Coding Assistants</h2><p>This exploration not only helped me tackle the challenges of code refactoring but also imparted an important lesson: AI is not omnipotent; however, through proper guidance, it can become a powerful assistant that amplifies our capabilities. When we learn to interact with AI as “coaches” rather than “questioners,” we often achieve better results.<br>Of course, this brings new demands; understanding best practices and methodologies becomes essential when collaborating with AI so that we can guide it effectively towards completing tasks correctly.<br>This shift in thinking allows us to better leverage human creativity alongside AI execution capabilities—enhancing both code quality and development efficiency (ideally saving time should promote improved code quality rather than merely pursuing high output; otherwise, we risk falling into another quagmire where chasing output neglects quality). Balancing efficiency with quality is crucial; by emphasizing readability, maintainability, and sound best practices in our codebase, we can accelerate development while ensuring long-term software health and stability.<br>In future endeavors, this human-machine collaborative model may emerge as a new paradigm in software development.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Final-Note-Prompt-Sharing\"><a href=\"#Final-Note-Prompt-Sharing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Final Note: Prompt Sharing\"></a>Final Note: Prompt Sharing</h2><p>Through practice, we’ve developed a prompt template specifically targeting code smell refactoring. If you’re interested in addressing code smells in your projects, feel free to try out this Prompt Template available on our site tailored for developers seeking efficient prompts that enhance their experience using Cursor for refactoring—especially aimed at those looking to optimize their refactoring processes through AI assistance.<br>This prompt template site aims at providing practical resources designed for developers looking for actionable templates that enhance their experience using Cursor for refactoring tasks while minimizing potential hallucinations during such processes.<br>We encourage everyone using Cursor or other AI coding assistance tools to share effective prompts within this repository.

title=\"结语：AI编码助手使用的新范式\"></a>结语：AI编码助手使用的新范式</h2><p>这次的探索不仅帮助我解决了代码重构的难题，更重要的是让我领悟到了一个道理：AI不是万能的，但通过正确的引导，它可以成为我们强大的助手，起到能力放大器的作用。当我们学会用”教练”而不是”提问者”的身份与AI互动时，往往能获得更好的结果。当然，这也给我们带来了新的要求：在与AI进行协作时，了解<strong>最佳实践</strong>和<strong>方法论</strong>成为了前提条件，只有这样，我们才能更有效地引导AI以正确的方式完成工作。</p>\n<p>这种思维方式的转变，让我们能够更好地发挥人类的创造力和AI的执行力，从而提升<strong>代码质量</strong>和<strong>开发效率</strong>（在理想情况下，提升开发效率应当将节省下来的时间来促进代码质量的提高，而不是单纯追求高产出，否则我们可能会陷入另一个无法自拔的漩涡。追逐产出而忽视质量，最终仍然会导致技术债务高筑，增加维护成本，甚至影响项目的可持续性。因此，平衡效率与质量至关重要。通过注重代码的可读性、可维护性和合理的使用最佳实践，我们不仅能够提高开发速度，还能确保软件的长期健康和稳定性）。在未来，这种人机协作的模式也许会成为软件开发的一种新范式。</p>\n<h2

            "content_html": "<p>前段时间，我看到了一篇博客介绍Cursor的，使得Cursor再次进入了我的视野。最近我有一个构建AI工具的想法，但由于对AI编程相关技术栈的局限，暂时搁置。因此，我重新安装了Cursor进行尝试，发现它已经进化成真正意义上的AI编程助手，于是决定利用Cursor实现之前的构想。</p>\n<h2 id=\"需求来源\"><a href=\"#需求来源\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"需求来源\"></a>需求来源</h2><p>相信BAU是所有团队都在处理的事情。对我而言，这些任务往往是“不想做，但又不得不做”的烦恼。尤其是当你已经总结出SOP后，每次处理时都感觉自己只是一个无情的BAU处理机器，繁琐而乏味。在这种情况下，我想，是否可以每次只需执行最简单的命令，就能自动执行我期望的动作？而Python脚本正是一个很好的解决方案。因此，我列出了所有需要完成的任务，并通过Python脚本实现了这些功能。</p>\n<p>通过这一过程，我成功实现了一键执行期望动作。下次再遇到相同的任务时，只需运行这个脚本，就能省去寻找资源和逐个文件分配权限的时间，效率瞬间从15分钟提升至1分钟。然而，这一解决方案仍然存在角色限制，仅限于技术性角色使用。那么，如何让非技术性角色也能使用这个解决方案呢？</p>\n<p>这个问题一直萦绕在我的脑中，直到我想到最近学习的LLM（大型语言模型）编程。灵光一现，我意识到可以让非技术性角色通过自然语言描述，然后由大模型解析这些自然语言并翻译成需要执行的脚本，再进行自动执行。</p>\n<h2 id=\"调研\"><a href=\"#调研\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"调研\"></a>调研</h2><p>说干就干，晚上下班后，我开始寻找合适的大模型。我的期望是：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>能在本地运行（方便调试）</li>\n<li>我的机器能够支持（有一台常规配置的MacOS M1 16G物理机）</li>\n<li>参数足够以进行文本到行为的转换</li>\n</ul>\n<p>最终，Ollama的Llama3.1 8B模型引起了我的注意。该模型可以直接在本地运行，而我2020年的M1 MacBook Pro恰好符合其要求，并且在自然语言处理方面表现出色。官方是这么描述的：<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/../images/llama3.1_8_B_description.png\" alt=\"llama3.1_8_B_description\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"分析与任务规划\"><a href=\"#分析与任务规划\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"分析与任务规划\"></a>分析与任务规划</h2><p>有了想法和大模型后，剩下的就是考虑如何实现。经过两周晚上的LLM编程入门课程学习，我了解到了Langchain这个框架，以及如何使用。有了Langchain，实现这一需求变得轻而易举。大致步骤如下：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>在本地使用Ollama运行Llama3.1 8B模型。</li>\n<li>构建脚本并放入合适的包中。</li>\n<li>使用Langchain构建链，并对方法及Prompt进行封装。</li>\n<li>调用封装好的方法进行自然语言分析，选择并执行需要的脚本。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>还有个问题在于，如何让大模型知道有哪些可执行脚本及其作用。针对这一问题，有多种选择，比如：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>使用提示模板</li>\n<li>使用分类器</li>\n<li>使用上下文管理</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>方法</th>\n<th>优点</th>\n<th>缺点</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>提示模板</strong></td>\n<td>简单易用：设计和实现相对简单，用户只需提供自然语言输入。</td>\n<td>局限性：可能无法涵盖所有可能的输入，导致复杂请求无法处理。</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>灵活性高：可以根据不同的需求快速调整模板。</td>\n<td>维护成本：随着需求变化，模板需要不断更新和维护。</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>可读性强：用户易于理解提示内容，便于培训和上手。</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>分类器</strong></td>\n<td>自动化程度高：能够自动识别和分类输入，适合处理大量数据。</td>\n<td>复杂性：需要大量的训练数据和时间来构建和优化分类器。</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>适应性强：可以通过训练模型提高分类精度。</td>\n<td>不确定性：分类结果可能不准确，导致错误的脚本被调用。</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>上下文管理</strong></td>\n<td>状态跟踪：能够在多个交互中保持上下文。</td>\n<td>实现复杂：需要设计复杂的状态管理机制。</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>智能响应：根据上下文信息提供更精准的响应。</td>\n<td>资源消耗：维护上下文信息可能消耗更多计算资源和内存。</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>经过权衡优缺点、实现复杂度与当前需求，我决定采用提示模板作为解决方案。</p>\n<p>万事俱备，“东风”

href=\"#Cursor的体验感受\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Cursor的体验感受\"></a>Cursor的体验感受</h2><ul>\n<li><strong>易用性</strong>：整个过程，没写一行代码，扮演“嘴强王者”，让Cursor成为你的码仔，它能无怨无求的按照要求写出代码。通过自然语言输入，用户可以轻松生成代码或执行复杂任务，这种无缝集成大大降低了技术门槛。</li>\n<li><strong>高效的代码生成</strong>：生成的代码通常处于可用状态，只需进行少量修改即可满足具体需求。</li>\n<li><strong>智能化的上下文理解</strong>：Cursor升级了模型后，支持超长上下文(200k)，使得它能够理解项目背景、代码结构及编码风格。这种能力不仅提升了生成代码的相关性和准确性，还使得模型能够根据历史交互进行智能响应，提供更为精准的建议和解决方案。能按照生成的既有风格进行演进。</li>\n<li><strong>知识储备与效能提升</strong>：你的技术知识储备越丰富，那么Cursor帮你提升的效率会越高。比如，如果方法论知识丰富，它能帮忙快速的提升代码的可读性、可维护性和扩展性，在重构方面表现尤为突出。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>当然现在的边界情况是简单产品，其实进入到深水区后，依然会遇到很多卡点，不过没关系，迈出的这一步很重要。</p>\n<h2

title=\"附上一些使用Cursor的技巧\"></a>附上一些使用Cursor的技巧</h3><ul>\n<li><strong>表述需求时的注意事项</strong>：在表述需求时，务必做到明确而谨慎。清晰的需求能够帮助 Cursor 精确理解并执行，而不必要的信息可能会增加实现的复杂性。例如，当我错误地提到使用Ollama3.1时，实际上在编写代码时，Cursor是将Ollama3.1作为模型引用的，但正确的模型应该是Llama3.1。同时，过度简化需求可能会导致 Cursor 自由发挥，产生不必要的偏差。例如，我最开始并没有提到使用大模型来满足需求，只是简单描述了需求。在最初的代码版本中，就并未采用大模型框架来实现。</li>\n<li><strong>README.md 文档的重要性</strong>：让 Cursor 从项目一开始就写 README.md 文档，记录清楚产品功能、实现技术栈等，并且让它在完成关键节点后及时更新。</li>\n<li><strong>中间版本的救命工具</strong>：用 Git 做版本管理，在关键成功节点提交时写好说明内容，给自己复原的机会。否则，等一段时间后，你想要回退到某一节点的时候，那个节点就已经找不到了。</li>\n<li><strong>使用 Composer 和 Chat 功能的建议</strong>：使用 Composer 和 Chat 功能时，尽量多 @codebase，否则 Cursor 常有幻觉，不知道项目内容是什么。</li>\n<li><strong>文档链接的整合</strong>：常用的文档链接可以加入 Docs 中，比如你习惯使用的 AI API 调用文档，方便在使用时随时 @。（太好用了）</li>\n<li><strong>隐私选项</strong>：如果用于项目，请记得勾上<a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/privacy\">Privacy Mode</a>，这个选项能够保证你的代码不被第三方或者Cursor官方保存。（明面上是这么说的）</li>\n</ul>\n<p>到此，我们的讨论就告一段落了。感谢大家的阅读和关注!</p>\n",
